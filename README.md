This project implements the Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT) model using PyMC to estimate both the latent consensus answers to 20 plant knowledge questions and the individual competence of 10 informants. The model assumes that informants vary in their probability of answering correctly and that agreement among informants is driven by shared cultural knowledge. Each informant’s competence was modeled with a Uniform(0.5, 1.0) prior, reflecting the assumption that responses are at least better than chance. Each consensus answer was modeled with a Bernoulli(0.5) prior, representing minimal prior belief about the correct answer. The probability of each informant’s response was defined using the standard CCT formula, and the observed data were modeled with a Bernoulli likelihood. All code was written to follow this structure closely, and model parameters were implemented as vectorized PyMC variables for clarity and efficiency.
Posterior sampling was performed using MCMC with 4 chains and 2000 draws per chain. Convergence diagnostics (R-hat ≈ 1.0 for all parameters) confirmed successful sampling. The posterior estimates showed that the most competent informant had a mean competence of approximately 0.87, while the least competent was around 0.56. The consensus answers inferred from the model closely matched a simple majority vote, differing on questions 1, 5, 7, 9, and 13. These differences are likely due to the model weighting informants by competence, rather than treating all responses equally. This was a reasonable assumption given the goal of identifying cultural knowledge, and allowed the model to account for disagreement more intelligently than naive aggregation. Where design choices were ambiguous, I prioritized interpretability and stayed close to the lecture and slide examples. I used AI to help me complete this project.
